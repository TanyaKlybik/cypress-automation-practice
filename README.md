## Running Cypress Tests

### Debug Mode

To run Cypress in debug mode, use the following command:

```sh
npx cypress open
```

This will open the Cypress Test Runner for interactive debugging.

### Headless Mode

To run Cypress tests in headless mode, use:

```sh
npx cypress run
```

This executes the tests in the command-line interface (CLI) without a UI.
